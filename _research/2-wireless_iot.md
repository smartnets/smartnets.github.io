Wireless communication and the Internet of Things (IoT) have revolutionized the way we interact with the world. IoT refers to the network of physical devices that are embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity, allowing them to exchange data with other devices and systems. Sensing technology plays a critical role in IoT, enabling devices to gather and transmit data about their surroundings. Data management is another essential aspect of IoT, involving the collection, processing, storage, and analysis of large volumes of data generated by IoT devices. Security is also a major concern in wireless and IoT systems, as the increasing number of connected devices creates new vulnerabilities and risks. Therefore, IoT systems require robust security measures to protect against cyber threats and ensure the integrity and privacy of the data being exchanged. In summary, wireless and IoT technologies offer tremendous potential for innovation and efficiency, but their success depends on effective sensing, data management, and security measures.
