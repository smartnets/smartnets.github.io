AI Services at the Network Edge refers to the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities into network infrastructure at the edge, bringing computation closer to the source of data generation. This approach allows for faster processing of data and enables real-time decision making, improving the overall efficiency of the system. Edge computing involves processing and analyzing data near the source rather than transmitting it to a centralized data center, reducing latency and network congestion. AI services at the network edge enable the deployment of intelligent applications that can learn and adapt to changing conditions, allowing for more efficient and effective use of resources. These services can also enhance security by detecting and responding to threats in real-time. Overall, AI services at the network edge represent a significant advancement in the field of AI, providing faster and more efficient processing of data while enabling the development of intelligent applications that can improve network performance and security.
