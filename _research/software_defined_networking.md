## Intelligent Synchronization and Controller Placement in Software-Defined Networks

As software-defined networks (SDNs) continue to evolve, new challenges emerge in maintaining efficient, reliable, and scalable control across increasingly dynamic and distributed environments. Our research focuses on building intelligent SDN control architectures that can adapt to changing network conditions while minimizing communication overhead and ensuring high network performance. We study how synchronization between controllers and their placement within the network affect overall system behavior, and we develop optimization frameworks to manage these processes effectively. By advancing synchronization strategies and placement algorithms, our goal is to design SDN systems that are more flexible, resilient, and capable of meeting the demands of future wireless and mobile networks.
