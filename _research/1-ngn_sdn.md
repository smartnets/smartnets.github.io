Next Generation Networks (NGNs) refer to the advanced communication infrastructure that has evolved from traditional telecommunications networks to meet the increasing demand for high-speed internet, multimedia content, and emerging technologies. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a technology that enables the centralized management and control of network resources by separating the network's control and data planes. Virtualization is a technology that allows the creation of virtual versions of physical resources such as servers, storage, and networks, enabling greater flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Edge Cloud refers to a distributed computing architecture that brings computing resources closer to the end-users, reducing latency and enabling real-time processing of data. Together, these technologies form the foundation for the next generation of communication networks, providing faster, more efficient, and more flexible infrastructure to support the increasing demand for connectivity and data processing.
