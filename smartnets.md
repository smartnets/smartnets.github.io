## SmartNets

__SmartNetsâ€™__ lab research is on architecture and optimization of **next generation networking** and computing systems with an emphasis on developing and supporting AI services as well as leveraging data driven and machine learning approaches for effective network design.

Ongoing projects include **SDN architectures** and virtualized services for mobile networks, federated and distributed learning, networking aspects in distributed ledger technologies and **blockchain**, data management and analytics in **Internet of Things**, system and networking aspects of AI services, market mechanisms for allocation of resources in virtualized network architectures, security and privacy in wireless systems and **quantum entanglement distribution networks**.
 
The methodological approaches and contributions of smartnet lab draw from complex network analysis, stochastic control, optimization, game theory and machine learning, while protype implementations are often demonstrated on the wireless and IoT testbed inhouse.
